"1"	"data"	"An SPHM object containing assay data and aSVG (s)."
"2"	"sam.factor"	"Applies to SummarizedExperiment (SE). Column name of sample replicates in colData slot. Default is NULL"
"3"	"con.factor"	"Applies to SE. Column name of condition replicates in colData slot. Default is NULL"
"4"	"ID"	"A character vector of row items for plotting spatial heatmaps"
"5"	"col.com"	"A character vector of color components for building colour scale. Default is c('yellow', 'orange','red')"
"6"	"col.bar"	"'selected' or 'all', the former means use values of ID to build the colour scale while the latter use all values in data. Default is 'selected'."
"7"	"bar.width"	"A numeric of colour bar width. Default is 0.7"
"8"	"trans.scale"	"One of 'log2', 'exp2', 'row', 'column', or NULL, which means transform the data by 'log2' or '2-base expoent', scale by 'row' or 'column', or no manipuation respectively."
"9"	"ft.trans"	"A vector of aSVG features to be transparent. Default is NULL."
"10"	"legend.r"	"A numeric to adjust the dimension of the legend plot. Default is 1. The larger, the higher ratio of width to height."
"11"	"sub.title.size"	"The title size of each spatial heatmap subplot. Default is 11."
"12"	"lay.shm"	"'gen' or 'con', applies to multiple genes or conditions respectively. 'gen' means spatial heatmaps are organised by genes while 'con' organised by conditions. Default is 'gen'"
"13"	"ncol"	"The total column number of spatial heatmaps, not including legend plot. Default is 2."
"14"	"ft.legend"	"'identical', 'all', or a vector of samples/features in aSVG to show in legend plot. 'identical' only shows matching features while 'all' shows all features."
"15"	"legend.ncol, legend.nrow"	"Two numbers of columns and rows of legend keys respectively. Default is NULL, NULL, since they are automatically set."
"16"	"legend.position"	"the position of legend keys ('none', 'left', 'right','bottom', 'top'), or two-element numeric vector. Default is 'bottom'."
"17"	"legend.key.size, legend.text.size"	"The size of legend keys and labels respectively. Default is 0.5 and 8 respectively."
"18"	"line.size, line.color"	"The size and colour of all plogyon outlines respectively. Default is 0.2 and 'grey70' respectively."
"19"	"verbose"	"TRUE or FALSE. Default is TRUE and the aSVG features not mapped are printed to R console."
"20"	"out.dir"	"The directory to save HTML and video files of spatial heatmaps. Default is NULL."
