OVERVIEW

    o The spatialHeatmap is an R/Bioconductor package and is designed for visualising gene expression data (sequencing, microarray, etc.). The core feature is to map expression values of target genes under different conditions to different tissues, which are called spatial heatmaps. To make it more versatile, the matrix heatmap and network features were also developed, which display the target gene in the context of corresponding gene module. All the utilities implemented in this R package are also combined as a web-browser based Shiny app. The application of this package is not limited to gene expression data. It can be used as long as a data matrix and an associated SVG image are provided, such as population data generated in different years across different cities.
