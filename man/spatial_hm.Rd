\value{
An image of spatial heatmap(s), a two-component list of the spatial heatmap(s) in \code{ggplot} format and a \code{data.frame} of mapping between assayed samples and aSVG features.
}
\description{
The input are a pair of annotated SVG (aSVG) file and formatted data (\code{vector}, \code{data.frame}, \code{SummarizedExperiment}). In the former, spatial features are represented by shapes and assigned unique identifiers, while the latter are numeric values measured from these spatial features and organized in specific formats. In biological cases, aSVGs are anatomical or cell structures, and data are measurements of genes, proteins, metabolites, \emph{etc}. in different samples (\emph{e.g.} cells, tissues). Data are mapped to the aSVG according to identifiers of assay samples and aSVG features. Only the data from samples having matching counterparts in aSVG features are mapped. The mapped features are filled with colors translated from the data, and the resulting images are termed spatial heatmaps. Note, "sample" and "feature" are two equivalent terms referring to cells, tissues, organs \emph{etc.} where numeric values are measured. Matching means a target sample in data and a target spatial feature in aSVG have the same identifier. \cr This function is designed as much flexible as to achieve optimal visualization. For example, subplots of spatial heatmaps can be organized by gene or condition for easy comparison, in multi-layer anotomical structures selected tissues can be set transparent to expose burried features, color scale is customizable to highlight difference among features. This function also works with many other types of spatial data, such as population data plotted to geographic maps.
