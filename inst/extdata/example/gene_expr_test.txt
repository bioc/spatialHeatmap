Phosphorylation of serine851 in the activation loop of PHOT1 appears to be required for stomatal opening, chloroplast accumulation, leaf flattening, and phototropism, and phosphorylation of serine849 may also contribute to the regulation of these responses. Phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the Hinge1 region of PHOT1 appears to require serine350 and serine376."

TRX z was previously named as Trx p (thioredoxin putative and plastidic) before its thioredoxin activity was confirmed (Meng et al., PNAS 2010, 107:3900). Knockout mutant of TRX z has a severe albino phenotype and is inhibited in chloroplast development. Two fructokinase-like proteins (FLN1 and FLN2), members of the pfkB-carbohydrate kinase family, are potential TRX z targets."

Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring.

PIF3 function as a transcriptional activator can be functionally and mechanistically separated from its role in repression of PhyB mediated processes., Transcription factor interacting with photoreceptors phyA and phyB. Forms a ternary complex in vitro with G-box element of the promoters of LHY, CCA1. Acts as a negative regulator of phyB signalling. It degrades rapidly after irradiation of dark grown seedlings in a process controlled by phytochromes. Does not play a  significant role in controlling light input and function of the circadian  clockwork. Binds to G- and E-boxes, but not to other ACEs. Binds to anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in a light- and HY5-independent fashion. PIF3 function as a transcriptional activator can be functionally and mechanistically separated from its role in repression of PhyB mediated processes."
