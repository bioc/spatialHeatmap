<p>The data matrix is shown as an interactive table. In this table, rows are gene IDs and columns are samples/conditions and/or gene metadata, the expression values of a sample can be sorted, and a particular gene can be searched by its ID. </p>

<b>Filter</b> <br/>

<b>Value (A) to exceed/Proportion (P) of samples with values >= A</b> Filter genes according to expression values. Genes with expression values at least A in at least samples of P proportion are retained. The initial values are set to very low so that no rows are filtered out on start.<br/>

<b>Min coefficient of variation (CV1)/Min coefficient of variation (CV2)</b> Filter genes according to the coefficient of variation (CV). Only genes with CV between CV1 and CV2 are kept. The initial values are set to very low or hight so that no rows are filtered out on start.<br/>

<b>Transform</b> <br/>
<b>Log/exp transform</b> Transform the data matrix by log2 or 2-base expoent (exp2). It is applicable if colored tissues cannot be distinguished due to low variance or outliers in the data. <br/>
<b>Scale by</b> Scale the data table by rows or columns. <br/>

<b>Re-order columns</b> Re-order/delete the columns. It is effective only after clicking the "Confirm" button.  <br/>

<b>Search</b> Search for rows with gene IDs, where IDs must only be separated by space or comma. <em>E.g.</em> HRE2,petL,rpl32. It is effective only after clicking "Submit". To return to the whole table, clear the field and click "Submit".<br/>
