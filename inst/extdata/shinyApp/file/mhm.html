<p>The nearest neighbors of each selected/target gene in the Expression Matrix are selected with correlation or distance measure independently, then all target genes and their nearest neighbors are hierarchically clustered and visualized in an interactive matrix heatmap, where target genes are labeled by black lines. The interactive features include 1) mouse over a cell to see row/column labels and cell value, and 2) draw a rectangle to zoom in and double click to zoom out. </p>

<p><b>Parameters: </b> Measure: measure used to select nearest neighbors, where "correlation" is Pearson correlation coefficent (PCC) and "distance" is Euclidean distance. Cor.absolute: use absolute PCC or not? Select by: genes with most similar expression profiles with each target gene are selected as nearest neighbors. The are three selection ways. The "proportion" means top proportion of most similar genes, "number" denotes a number of top most similar genes, and "value" means most similar genes with similarity above a specific value of cutoff. Scale: scale the matrix heatmap by column, by row, or no scale. Show plot: the matrix heatmap is shown only after "Yes" is checked. </p>
