<p>"Step 3: is column or row gene?" specifies if column or row is gene in the data matrix, where gene is a general term standing for proteins, metabolites, etc. "Step 4: separator" specifies the separator in the matrix.  </p>

<p>"Compute locally" takes the adjacency matrix "adj.txt" and module definition "mod.txt" generated by the function <code style="color:brown">adj_mod</code>. Network module is identified with WGCNA (Langfelder and Horvath 2008) and the process is computationally intensive for large data matrix (e.g. > 10,000 genes). To avoid repetitive computation, the two files can be saved and then uploaded to this app at a later time. Refer to function <code style="color:brown">adj_mod</code> in spatialHeatmap for details.</p>
