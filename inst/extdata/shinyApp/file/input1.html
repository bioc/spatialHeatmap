<b>Custom computed data</b> This field should be used if "custom_computed_data" is slected in "Step 1: data sets". It takes the adjacency matrix "adj.txt" and module definition "mod.txt" generated by the function <code style="color:brown">adj_mod</code> in "spatialHeatmap". Network modules are identified with WGCNA (Langfelder and Horvath 2008) and the process is computationally intensive for large data matrix (<em>e.g.</em> > 10,000 genes). To avoid repetitive computation and maintain good performance, the computation could be done separately and results are saved in "adj.txt", "mod.txt".
