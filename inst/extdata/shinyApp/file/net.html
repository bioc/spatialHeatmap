<p>This section applies network analysis on all genes in the Matrix Heatmap with WGCNA (Langfelder and Horvath 2008). Briefly, a correlation matrix or distance matrix is computed on all genes in Matrix Heatmap, and transformed to an adjacency matrix and topological overlap matrix (TOM) sequentially, which are advanced measures to quantify coexpression similarity. Then network modules are identified by hierarchinally clustering the TOM-transformed dissimilarity matrix 1-TOM, which are clusters of genes with highly similar coexpression profiles. The module containing a target gene is finally displayed as interactive network graph. Since this is a coexpression analysis, variables of sample/condition should be at least 5. Otherwise, resulting modules are not reliable. Refer to <a href='https://jianhaizhang.github.io/SVG_tutorial_file/vignette.html'>package vignette</a> for details. </p>

<b>Minmum module size:</b> Expected minimum module size in gene module identification.<br/>
<b>Network type:</b> Transformation of correlation and distance measure. For "unsigned", adjacency = |cor|^power; for "signed", adjacency = (0.5 * (1+cor) )^power; for "signed hybrid", adjacency = cor^power if cor>0 and 0 otherwise; and for "distance", adjacency = (1-(dist/max(dist))^2)^power, where power is 1 for "distance" and 6 otherwise. <br/>
<b>Select a target gene:</b> All gene IDs chosen in Data Matrix are listed here. Once a gene is selected in this list, the network modules are identified at two alternative sensitivity levels (ds=2 or 3). <br/>
<b>Module splitting sensitivity level:</b> From 2 to 3, the sensitivity increases and results in more modules with smaller sizes.<br/>
<b>Color scheme:</b> In the network, nodes and edges are genes and adjacency between genes respectively. There is an interactive color bar to denote gene connectivity (sum of a gene's adjacency with all its direct neighbours). The separaters in color ingredients could be comma, semicolon, single space, dot, hypen, or, underscore, <em>e.g.</em> the default are "purple,yellow,blue", which means gene connectivity increases from yellow to blue.<br/>
<b>Adjacency threshold:</b> If too many edges (<em>e.g.</em> > 300) are displayed, the app can possibly get stuck. This field sets a threthold to filter out some weak edges. The number of total remaining edges is output below this field.<br/>
<b>Show plot:</b> If not too many edges are left (<em>e.g.</em> < 300), checking "Yes" would display the network. To maintain acceptable performance, users are advised to choose a stringent threshold (<em>e.g.</em> 0.9) initially, then decrease the value gradually. The interactive feature allows users to zoom in and out, or drag a gene around. All the gene IDs in the gene module are listed in <b>Select by id </b> in decreasing order according to gene connectivity. The selected gene ID is appended "_target" for easy identification.
